This is a test harness to see if a given build of WM2 builds. It is not intended to be used as such.

To get this to work, one needs to edit the 3 settings.py files with the relevant info/logins/tracker stuffs before building the container.

To then access the container, you can point your browser to port 8089 on the host and login with whatwmuser/whatwmpass as credentials.

DO NOT USE THIS IN PRODUCTION AS NO DATASTORES EXIST.
